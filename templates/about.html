      Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe is my second large project and was inspired by 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy">this Wikipedia article</a>
      on how a person might play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe. As someone who is interested in the design of
      modern chess playing computers, I thought that starting with tic-tac-toe would be a good way to get an 
      introduction to how a programmer might go about developing software that can play games. Ultimately, I would
      love to build a chess engine using more advanced algorithms such as neural networks.
