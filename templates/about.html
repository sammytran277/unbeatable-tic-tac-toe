      Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe is my second project and was inspired by 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy">this Wikipedia article</a>
      on how a player might play a perfect game of Tic-Tac-Toe. As someone who is interested in the design of
      modern Chess playing computers, I thought that starting with Tic-Tac-Toe would be a good way to get an 
      introduction to how a programmer might go about developing software that can play games.
